# Diagrams & Visuals — instructions to generate

This file explains the diagrams you can add to the final report.

1. Use Case Diagram — actors: Data Scientist, Business User, Admin
2. Sequence Diagram — Streamlit -> API -> Model
3. Architecture Diagram — Presentation / Application / Data layers
4. Data Flow Diagram — training -> model -> API -> UI
5. Deployment Diagram — dev vs. prod (containers / render)
6. Activity Diagram — user enters request -> API -> Model -> response

You can draw diagrams using:
- draw.io (diagrams.net)
- Mermaid (for markdown-supported diagrams)
- PlantUML / Graphviz (if you prefer programmatic generation)
